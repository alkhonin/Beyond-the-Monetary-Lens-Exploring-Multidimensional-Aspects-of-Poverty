# Rethinking the Poverty Line: Adequacy and Need for Multidimensional Updates

**Author:** Abdulaziz Alkhonin

## Introduction

Welcome to "Rethinking the Poverty Line," an exploration that challenges and expands our understanding of global poverty. Inspired by Max Roser's insightful work, this project reevaluates conventional poverty metrics and advocates for a more dynamic, multifaceted approach. Our journey reconsiders the adequacy of current poverty lines, emphasizing the necessity to factor in inflation rates for a more accurate global poverty assessment. Furthermore, we delve beyond monetary measures to include crucial aspects such as education, healthcare, and essential infrastructure, aiming to unveil the multifaceted nature of poverty.

## Project Overview

In this project, we critically analyze traditional poverty metrics and propose an annual revision of the poverty threshold, integrating global inflation dynamics. We explore various poverty lines – from the International Poverty Line to higher thresholds like $30 per day – to understand their implications in different economic contexts.

### Key Conclusions:

1. **Dynamic Poverty Thresholds**: Our findings suggest that static poverty lines fail to reflect the real-time economic challenges faced by the impoverished. Regular updates to the poverty line, considering inflation, are essential for accurate and relevant poverty measurement.

2. **Beyond Monetary Measures**: Incorporating multidimensional poverty metrics reveals a broader spectrum of deprivation. This approach highlights the limitations of purely income-based assessments and underscores the need for more inclusive poverty analysis.

3. **Global Variability in Poverty**: Different poverty thresholds paint contrasting pictures of global poverty. Higher thresholds, while illuminating hardships in wealthier nations, may obscure progress in developing regions. Conversely, lower thresholds like $2.15 a day offer a focused view of extreme poverty but might not capture broader economic struggles.

4. **Supportive or Refutative Findings**: Our analysis supports the hypothesis that a singular global poverty line might oversimplify the complexities of poverty. It also refutes the notion that higher income thresholds universally indicate better living conditions, as economic struggles exist even above these lines.
