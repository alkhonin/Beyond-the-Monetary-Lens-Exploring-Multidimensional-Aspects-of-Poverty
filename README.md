Title:
Rethinking the Poverty Line: Adequacy and Need for Multidimensional Updates

Author:
Abdulaziz Alkhonin

Introduction:

In this project, we delve into the intricate landscape of global poverty and advocate for a dynamic approach to poverty measurement. We will not only consider the traditional monetary poverty line but also explore the significance of multidimensional poverty metrics that encompass education, healthcare, and more. By examining poverty thresholds ranging from $30 to $2.15 per day, we uncover the diverse realities across countries. Additionally, we emphasize the transformative power of economic growth in reducing poverty and propose the annual adjustment of poverty lines to reflect changing economic conditions. Join us on this journey to gain a deeper understanding of global poverty dynamics.
