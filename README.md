Title: 
Rethinking the Poverty Line: Adequacy and Need for Multidimensional Updates

Author: 
Abdulaziz Alkhonin

Introduction:

In this exploration inspired by Max Roser's groundbreaking work, I reevaluate conventional notions of poverty, highlighting the imperative for more dynamic and comprehensive measurements. This investigation advocates for an annual revision of the poverty threshold, factoring in inflation rates to provide a more accurate global poverty overview. Beyond monetary considerations, I challenge the narrow focus by incorporating vital elements such as education, healthcare, and essential infrastructure. My objective is to broaden the spectrum of poverty analysis, potentially uncovering marginalized individuals often overlooked by current metrics. Join me in rethinking poverty, taking a step towards a more inclusive understanding.
